Enterprise License and Use Policy
=================================

This project is offered in a dual-licensing model:

- Community License: MIT (see LICENSE)
- Enterprise License: Required for enterprise use (see below)

What counts as enterprise use?
- Operating the software in production as part of a commercial product or service
- Use by companies, organizations, or teams for internal business processes
- Use that requires vendor support, SLAs, or indemnification

If your usage falls under “enterprise use,” you must obtain written permission
or a commercial license from the maintainers before using the software in that
context.

How to request permission or a commercial license
- Open an issue in this repository titled “Enterprise License Request,” or
- Contact the maintainers through your usual channel to initiate a license discussion

Notes
- The MIT License remains available for community and open-source usage.
- Dual-licensing terms do not remove or restrict rights granted under the MIT
  license for community use; they provide an additional commercial option for
  enterprise scenarios that require it.
